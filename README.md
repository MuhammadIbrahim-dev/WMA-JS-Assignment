Assignment
1. Light Bulb Experiment
Objective: Simulate a light bulb's on/off state.
Task:
Write a program that asks the user to input either 1 (turn on) or 0 (turn off).
Use an if condition to print "The light is ON" or "The light is OFF."
Extension: Add a third option to print "Invalid Input" if the user enters anything other than 1 or 0.

2. Traffic Light Simulator
Objective: Simulate traffic light behavior.
Task:
Accept an input (Red, Yellow, Green) from the user.
Use if conditions to display:
"Stop" for Red
"Slow Down" for Yellow
"Go" for Green
Extension: Add a default message for invalid inputs like "Invalid Color."

3. Water Temperature Checker
Objective: Categorize water temperature based on input.
Task:
Ask the user to input the temperature in Celsius.
Use if conditions to print:
"Freezing" if temperature <= 0
"Cold" if temperature > 0 and <= 15
"Warm" if temperature > 15 and <= 30
"Hot" if temperature > 30

4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
Objective: Simulate a simple game.
Task:
Accept inputs for two players (rock, paper, or scissors).
Use if conditions to determine the winner:
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beats Paper
Print "Player 1 Wins," "Player 2 Wins," or "It's a Tie!"

5. Simple Alarm System
Objective: Simulate an alarm trigger based on conditions.
Task:
Ask the user two yes/no questions:
Is the door open? (yes or no)
Is motion detected? (yes or no)
Use if conditions to print:
"Alarm Triggered" if either condition is yes.
"All Safe" if both conditions are no.

6. Simple Temperature Conversion
Objective: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa.
Task:
Ask the user to choose a conversion type: 1 for Celsius to Fahrenheit, 2 for Fahrenheit to Celsius.
Take the temperature as input and use the formulas:
C to F: F=(C×9/5)+32F = (C \times 9/5) + 32F=(C×9/5)+32
F to C: C=(F−32)×5/9C = (F - 32) \times 5/9C=(F−32)×5/9
Print the result using if conditions to ensure the correct formula is applied.

7. Password Strength Checker
Objective: Check the strength of a password.
Task:
Take a password as input and check conditions:
Length >= 8: Print "Strong Password"
Length between 5 and 7: Print "Moderate Password"
Length < 5: Print "Weak Password"
Extension: Check if the password contains numbers or special characters for more detailed feedback.

8. Coin Toss Simulator
Objective: Simulate a coin toss.
Task:
Ask the user to input 1 for "Heads" or 0 for "Tails."
Use the random module to simulate a coin toss (random.randint(0, 1)).
Compare the user’s input with the result and print "You Win!" or "You Lose!"

9. Weather Suggestion Experiment
Objective: Give outfit suggestions based on weather conditions.
Task:
Take weather input (Sunny, Rainy, Cold) from the user.
Print:
"Wear sunglasses" for Sunny
"Take an umbrella" for Rainy
"Wear a jacket" for Cold

10. Simple Arithmetic Quiz
Objective: Test arithmetic skills interactively.
Task:
Generate two random numbers and a random operator (+, -, *, /) using the random module.
Ask the user to calculate the result.
Compare the user's answer with the correct answer using an if condition and print "Correct!" or "Try Again!"
11. Eligibility for Voting
Write a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age (age >= 18).

12. Maximum of Two Numbers
Write a program that accepts two numbers and prints the larger number using if conditions.
